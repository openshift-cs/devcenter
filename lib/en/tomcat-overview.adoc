= Tomcat Application Hosting
[.lead]
With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Java applications on Apache Tomcat with your favorite application frameworks and datastores. OpenShift Online currently supports `Tomcat 6` and `7` via our `JBoss EWS` cartridge.

TIP: Apache Tomcat is an open source software implementation of the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies. It powers numerous large-scale, mission-critical web applications across a diverse range of industries and organizations.

Learn more at the link:http://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat homepage].

== Simplify Your Tomcat Deployments

Getting a Java app with a MySQL backend deployed onto OpenShift with Tomcat is as easy as executing two commands:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp jbossews-2.0
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your server and install and configure Tomcat (via JBoss EWS), MySQL, a git repository on the server, and a simple web application. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/

== The Tomcat (JBossEWS) Cartridge
The `jbossews` cartridge provides Tomcat on OpenShift via the JBoss EWS package. This cartridge has special functionality to enable integration with OpenShift and with other cartridges. See the link:http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_guide.html#tomcat-cartridge-integrations[Cartridge Integrations] and
link:http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_guide.html#tomcat-environment-variable-replacement-support[Environment Variable Replacement Support] sections for details.

=== Template Repository Layout

webapps/           Location for built WARs (details below)
src/               Example Maven source structure
pom.xml            Example Maven build file
.openshift/        Location for OpenShift specific files
    config/          Location for configuration files such as server.xml
    action_hooks/    See the Action Hooks documentation <1>

=== Layout and Deployment Options
There are two options for deploying content to the Tomcat Server within OpenShift. Both options
can be used together (i.e. build one archive from source and others pre-built)

*Method 1 (Preferred)* +
You can upload your content in a Maven src structure as is this sample project and on
Git push have the application built and deployed.  For this to work you'll need your pom.xml at the
root of your repository and a maven-war-plugin like in this sample to move the output from the build
to the webapps directory.  By default the warName is ROOT within pom.xml.  This will cause the
webapp contents to be rendered at `http://app_name-namespace.rhcloud.com/`.  If you change the warName in
`pom.xml` to app_name, your base url would then become `http://app_name-namespace.rhcloud.com/app_name`.

NOTE: If you are building locally you'll also want to add any output wars under webapps from the build to your `.gitignore` file.

NOTE: If you are running scaled EWS then you need an application deployed to the root context (i.e. http://app_name-namespace.rhcloud.com/) for the HAProxy load-balancer to recognize that the EWS instance is active.

*Method 2* +
You can commit pre-built wars into `webapps`. To do this with the default repo, first run `git rm -r src/ pom.xml` from the root of your repo.

Basic workflows for deploying pre-built content (each operation will require associated Git add/commit/push operations to take effect):

. Add new zipped content and deploy it: `cp target/example.war webapps/`
. Undeploy currently deployed content: `git rm webapps/example.war`
. Replace currently deployed zipped content with a new version and deploy it: `cp target/example.war webapps/`

NOTE: You can get the information in the uri above from running `rhc domain show`

If you have already committed large files to your Git repo, you rewrite or reset the history of those files in Git
to an earlier point in time and then `git push --force` to apply those changes on the remote OpenShift server.  A
`git gc` on the remote OpenShift repo can be forced with (Note: tidy also does other cleanup including clearing log
files and tmp dirs):

[source]
--
$ rhc app tidy -a appname
--

Whether you choose option 1) or 2) the end result will be the application
deployed into the `webapps` directory. The `webapps` directory in the
Tomcat distribution is the location end users can place
their deployment content (e.g. war, ear, jar, sar files) to have it
automatically deployed into the server runtime.

=== Environment Variables

The Tomcat cartridge provides several environment variables to reference for ease of use:

OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_IP:: The IP address used to bind EWS
OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_HTTP_PORT:: The EWS listening port
OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_JPDA_PORT:: The EWS JPDA listening port
JAVA_OPTS_EXT:: Appended to JAVA_OPTS prior to invoking the Java VM.

For more information about environment variables, consult the link:oo_user_guide.html#environment-variables[Users Guide].

[[tomcat-environment-variable-replacement-support]]
.Environment Variable Replacement Support
****
The `jbossews` cart provides special environment variable replacement functionality for some of the Tomcat configuration files. For the following configuration files:

* `.openshift/config/server.xml`
* `.openshift/config/context.xml`

Ant-style environment replacements are supported for all `OPENSHIFT_`-prefixed environment variables in the application. For example, the following replacements are valid in `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
--
<Connector address="${OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_IP}"
           port="${OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_HTTP_PORT}"
           protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443" />
--

During server startup, the configuration files in the source repository are processed to replace `OPENSHIFT_*` values, and the resulting processed file is copied to the live Tomcat configuration directory.
****

[[tomcat-cartridge-integrations]]
=== Cartridge Integrations
The `jbossews` cart has out-of-the-box integration support with the RedHat `postgresql` and `mysql` cartridges. The default
`context.xml` contains two basic JDBC `Resource` definitions, `jdbc/MySQLDS` and `jdbc/PostgreSQLDS`, which will be automatically
configured to work with their respective cartridges if installed into your application.

=== Markers
Adding marker files to `.openshift/markers` will have the following effects:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Marker |Effect

|enable_jpda
|Will enable the JPDA socket based transport on the java virtual machine running the Tomcat server. This enables you to remotely debug code running inside Tomcat.

|skip_maven_build
|Maven build step will be skipped

|force_clean_build
|Will start the build process by removing all non-essential Maven dependencies.  Any current dependencies specified in your pom.xml file will then be re-downloaded.

|hot_deploy
|Will prevent a JBoss container restart during build/deployment. Newly build archives will be re-deployed automatically by the JBoss HDScanner component.

|java7
|Will run Tomcat with Java7 if present. If no marker is present then the baseline Java version will be used (currently Java6)
