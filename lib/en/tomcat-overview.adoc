== The Tomcat (JBossEWS) Cartridge
The `jbossews` cartridge provides Tomcat on OpenShift via the JBoss EWS package. This cartridge has special functionality to enable integration with OpenShift and with other cartridges. See *Cartridge Integrations* (below) and
link:tomcat-environment-variables.html[Environment Variable Replacement Support] for details.

=== Cartridge Integrations
The `jbossews` cart has out-of-the-box integration support with the RedHat `postgresql` and `mysql` cartridges. The default
`context.xml` contains two basic JDBC `Resource` definitions, `jdbc/MySQLDS` and `jdbc/PostgreSQLDS`, which will be automatically
configured to work with their respective cartridges if installed into your application.
