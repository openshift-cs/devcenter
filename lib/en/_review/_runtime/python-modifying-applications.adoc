== Making Code Modifications

In link:getting-started-creating-applications-python.html[the last section] we used OpenShift and a single RHC command to create a Python application running in the cloud. In a matter of seconds the application was live on the Internet; when we visited its URL we got back the OpenShift equivalent of a 'Hello World' page, including some useful information on what to do next. Spinning up an application quickly and easily like this is pretty cool, but a static page can only entertain for so long. In this section we will modify the default application to do something more exciting and deploy the changes to OpenShift.

=== Cloning Code to Your Local Machine

When you create an OpenShift application with the RHC command-line tools, by default the new Git repository created on the OpenShift gear will be cloned to your local machine. The contents will end up in a new directory with the same name as the application, created inside the directory in which you ran the +rhc app create+ command. If you would like the repository to be cloned to a different location, specify this by adding the `--repo __repo_dir_path__` option to your +rhc app create+ command; the repository contents will be cloned into the directory specified, which should either be empty or not yet exist. If you do not wish to clone the Git repository as part of the app creation process, you can add the `--no-git` flag.

If you choose not to clone the OpenShift application repository when you create the app, or something goes wrong and the clone fails, you can clone it later using the command `rhc git-clone`. This is a wrapper for the standard +git clone+ command that provides some extra benefits: you can specify what to clone by using the application's name, rather than its full Git URL, and it adds some RHC configuration data to the Git repository config. This means that you can run RHC commands from within the cloned directory without having to specify the application to which you wish them to apply with `-a __appname__`. Where RHC commands shown in this book omit the `-a __appname__` option, it is because they are being run within an app repository cloned via RHC, either with +rhc app create+ or +rhc git-clone+.

To view the Git URL for your OpenShift application, run the command `rhc app show -a __appname__`.

[TIP]
====
In order to clone an application repository, you must have supplied OpenShift with an SSH public key for the machine on which you are working. If you have not yet done this, run the command `rhc setup`. Go to link:managing-remote-connection.html[Remote Connection] for more information.

=== Modifying Application Code

Once you have a local copy of the OpenShift application repository you can modify the code using whatever tool you prefer: a command-line text editor, a graphical editor, or an IDE. For our example application, we will start by making a few changes to add and utilize the Python Flask microframework. Writing raw Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) apps is not much fun. Flask is a lightweight alternative that will give us just enough support to fulfill our app's main aim: insulting people. To learn more about Flask, see http://flask.pocoo.org[its website].

First up, we need to add Flask as a dependency. To do this, we navigate to the local cloned __insultapp__ repository and open the __requirements.txt__ file with our chosen editor (long live the Vim, though some of us believe Nano rules). We simply have to add a line to declare the dependency for Flask:

[source,python]
----
FLask==0.10.1
----

The next file we need to edit is __wsgi.py__. It contains the HTML for the "Welcome to your Python application on OpenShift" page we saw created in the previous. We do not need any of the template code, so we delete everything beneath the comment lines marked as 'IMPORTANT'. Beneath the comment, we add the line +from routes import app as application+, referencing the application code we are about to add next. Here is the source of the resulting __application__ file:

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/python
import os

virtenv = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_DIR'] + '/virtenv/'
virtualenv = os.path.join(virtenv, 'bin/activate_this.py')
try:
    execfile(virtualenv, dict(__file__=virtualenv))
except IOError:
    pass
#
# IMPORTANT: Put any additional includes below this line.  If placed above this
# line, it's possible required libraries won't be in your searchable path.
#
from routes import app as application
----

Finally, we add a new file in the same directory called __routes.py__. This contains a single route for the application's root directory, which maps to an ++insult++ function that returns the mildly irritating string, "Hello, code monkey!" Here is the code:

[source,python]
----
import os
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
# Keeps Flask from swallowing error messages
app.config['PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS'] = True

@app.route("/")
def insult():
    return "Hello, code monkey!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
----

In _routes.py_ we create a Flask application type called +app+. From there we use annotations to define that HTTP requests to the root URL get handled by the function +insult+. The _application_ file loads the Python virtual environment (a mechanism for having different Python libraries on the same machine) and imports the +app+ from the +routes+ module defined in _routes.py_.


Now that we have made some changes to the application code base, we should commit them to the local Git repository. We can do that with the following Git commands: +add+ to add the changes to the repository index, and +commit+ to record the new contents of the index. It is good practice to use the +git status+ command before each one to make sure you are clear on what is happening, although for brevity this is not shown here:


[source]
--
<screen>
[me@localhost ~/insultapp]$ <emphasis role="strong">git add -A</emphasis>
[me@localhost ~/insultapp]$ <emphasis role="strong">git commit -m "Added Flask microframework"</emphasis>
[master b1d87e3] Added Flask microframework
 3 files changed, 32 insertions(+), 315 deletions(-)
 rewrite wsgi/application (99%)
 create mode 100644 wsgi/routes.py
</screen>
--

The code changes are now committed on our local machine, but our OpenShift app remains unaffected. In the next section, we will push our modifications to the cloud.

=== Building and Deploying Your Code

Once you have committed your code changes, you can deploy them to OpenShift with just one command: +git push+. There is no special binary or secret sauce involved; it is just pure Git and SSH. If we run the command +git status+, we can see that we have modifications ready and raring to go. The `git push` command sends them on their merry way up into the cloud:


[source]
--
<screen>
[me@localhost ~/insultapp]$ <emphasis role="strong">git status</emphasis>
# On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
nothing to commit, working directory clean
[me@localhost ~/insultapp]$ <emphasis role="strong">git push</emphasis>
</screen>
--

We have not included the full output of the +push+ command here as it was quite lengthy, but here are some choice snippets:


----
remote: Stopping PYTHON cart
...
remote: Building git ref 'master', commit b1d87e3
...
remote: Installed /var/lib/openshift/6e7672676e61676976757570/app-root/runtime
/repo
remote: Processing dependencies for Insult-App==1.0
...
remote: Processing Flask-0.10.1.tar.gz
...
remote: Preparing build for deployment
...
remote: Activating deployment
...
remote: Starting PYTHON cart
remote: Result: success
remote: Activation status: success
remote: Deployment completed with status: success
----

Note that each time new code is deployed, the directory on the gear containing the current copy of the Git repository is blown away and then replaced with an updated copy, so anything stored there between deployments will be lost. We explain where you can store files persistently in>>>.

[TIP]
====
By default, pushing code changes to the OpenShift repository will also trigger a deployment; however, this behavior can be changed.
====

As we can see from the console output, when code is pushed to OpenShift it kicks off a build lifecycle, which has build and deployment phases. This lifecycle will differ slightly depending on the application cartridge in use, whether or not the app is scalable, and whether or not a builder cartridge such as Jenkins is included. In the case of our example app, the Python cartridge is stopped, the Git repository is cloned, a series of Python-specific processes occur to fetch dependencies and prepare the app, the resulting build is deployed, and the cartridge is restarted. You will learn more about most of these other pieces of application deployment in later sections.

Once this cycle is complete, we can visit our application URL in a browser and are now greeted with "Hello, code monkey!" (see <<screenshot_hellocodemonkey>>).

If you don't need to start and stop the server with each git push, you can use a link:hot-deploy.html[hot deploy marker] to just build and deploy.

Our app is looking pretty good now, but a single canned insult will get old fast. We will make things more entertaining by adding some randomization, Elizabethan style. There is a list of insulting Shakespearean words that has been floating around the Internet practically since it was a twinkle in someone's eye (no, not Al Gore). There are two columns of adjectives and one column of nouns; the idea is to combine one word from each column. Our next step is to gather a few insulting words and add a __insulter.py__ file to encapsulate the serious business logic of contempt:

[source,python]
----
from random import choice

def insult():
    return "Thou " + generate_insult() + "!"

def named_insult(name):
    return name + ", thou " + generate_insult() + "!"

def generate_insult():
    first_adjs = ["artless", "bawdy", "beslubbering", "bootless", "churlish"]
    second_adjs = ["base-court", "bat-fowling", "beef-witted", "beetle-headed",
     "boil-brained"]
    nouns = ["apple-john", "baggage", "barnacle", "bladder", "boar-pig"]

    return choice(first_adjs) + " " + choice(second_adjs) + " " + choice(nouns)
----

We use the +choice+ function in the +random+ module to select a random element in the Python lists, such as +first_adjs+. Next, we change the code in __routes.py__ to make use of our new functions:

[source,python]
----

from flask import Flask
import insulter

app = Flask(__name__)
# Keeps Flask from swallowing error messages
app.config['PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS'] = True

@app.route("/")
def insult():
    return insulter.insult()

@app.route("/<name>")
def insult_name(name):
    return insulter.named_insult(name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
----

Notice we import the +insulter+ module (the file named _insulter.py_) and then use the two insult-constructing functions to generate our insults. You can also see that in the second +@app.route+ we are grabbing any text after the +/+ and making it available to the function +insult_name+ as a parameter called +name+. We added this function for cases when only a personalized insult will do.

We add and commit those changes to the Git repository, and then the final step is to +git push+ our latest two commits. The output from OpenShift shows that the server has not been stopped and restarted because hot deployment is enabled:


----
remote: Not stopping cartridge python because hot deploy is enabled
...
remote: Not starting cartridge python because hot deploy is enabled
----

Once the new code has hit the cloud, we can refresh the app for some random Shakespearean insult fun (see <<screenshot_randominsults>>).

In this section we showed how to modify OpenShift application starter code, spicing up our Python demo app with logic to insult its users. We achieved this with Git commands including +add+, +status+, +commit+, +push+, and, with the help of RHC, +clone+. We also explained how we can add custom scripts to the application lifecycle with action hooks, and how to use a marker file to configure an app to hot deploy.
