[[integration]]
== Integrating the Service With Your App
Once you have link:external-services-overview.html#subscribe-service[subscribed to this service] and link:external-services-overview.html#locate-credentials[located your credentials], you will need to configure your application to use the credentials for your service.

=== Searchly Environment Variables

|===
|Variable Name|Example Value
|SEARCHLY_SSLURI|https://gopivotal:932274a12ed3453867dcc0cfcab57480@fili-us-east-1.searchly.com

|===

Use the link:managing-client-tools.html[OpenShift client tools] to set environment variables to make your credentials available within your application runtime:
