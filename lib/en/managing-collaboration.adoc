All OpenShift Online plans allow you to mange users that have access to one or more of your OpenShift domains. Premium plans extend this functionality by allowing for additional domains and management of teams.

=== Managing Domain Membership
All OpenShift Online users have the ability to add collaborators at the domain level. Other OpenShift users can be given access to either View, Edit, or Administer applications associated with a shared domain. The default role for additional members is `edit`.

==== Web Console
After logging into the web console, you will see a list of your current domains and applications. Click on the domain you would like to share. You can also select the domain from the *Settings* tab in the top navigation. In the below example, the domain *exampledomainone* is selected from the *Applications* list:

Next, you will see the details of the domain you've selected. All current OpenShift users that have access to this domain will be listed under the *Members* section. If there are no members, as in the example below, you can click on *Add members...*

You can then add new users to the domain, granting either *view*, *edit*, or *administer* access for the user. The user will have access to all applications associated with this domain. Bronze and Silver users will also have the option of adding a team to the domain (see below).

Once the new user is added, they will be able to access applications in the shared domain by logging into their own individual OpenShift Online account.

==== Command Line (rhc)
Add a user to a domain with the following command, specifying the user login and domain name.

TIP: The user login must be a registered OpenShift Online user.

[source]
----
$ rhc member add <openshift_username> -n <domain_name>
----

When a member is added to a domain, they receive the default role of edit. Use the --role option when adding a member to specify a different role:

[source]
----
$ rhc member add <openshift_username> -n <domain_name> --role <member_role>
----

TIP: The three roles available are +view+, +edit+, and +administer+.
