= Tomcat Environment Variables

The Tomcat cartridge provides several environment variables to reference for ease of use:

`OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_IP` +
The IP address used to bind EWS

`OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_HTTP_PORT` +
The EWS listening port

`OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_JPDA_PORT` +
The EWS JPDA listening port

`JAVA_OPTS_EXT` +
Appended to JAVA_OPTS prior to invoking the Java VM.

For more information, consult the link:managing-environment-variables.html[Environment Variables] guide.

.Environment Variable Replacement Support
****
The `jbossews` cart provides special environment variable replacement functionality for some of the Tomcat configuration files. For the following configuration files:

* `.openshift/config/server.xml`
* `.openshift/config/context.xml`

Ant-style environment replacements are supported for all `OPENSHIFT_`-prefixed environment variables in the application. For example, the following replacements are valid in `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
--
<Connector address="${OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_IP}"
           port="${OPENSHIFT_JBOSSEWS_HTTP_PORT}"
           protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443" />
--

During server startup, the configuration files in the source repository are processed to replace `OPENSHIFT_*` values, and the resulting processed file is copied to the live Tomcat configuration directory.
