  'protocol' => 'smtp',
  'smtp_host' => getenv('SENDGRID_HOSTNAME'),
  'smtp_user' => getenv('SENDGRID_USERNAME'),
  'smtp_pass' => getenv('SENDGRID_PASSWORD'),
  'smtp_port' => 587,
  'crlf' => "\r\n",
  'newline' => "\r\n"
));

$this->email->from('your@example.com', 'Your Name');
$this->email->to('someone@example.com');
$this->email->cc('another@another-example.com');
$this->email->bcc('them@their-example.com');
$this->email->subject('Email Test');
$this->email->message('Testing the email class.');
$this->email->send();

echo $this->email->print_debugger();
----

TIP: It is important to use the correct end of lines using "crlf" => "\r\n" and "newline" => "\r\n".

See more information on how to link:http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/email.html[use CodeIgniter with SendGrid].

[[php-laravel]]
=== PHP: Laravel
Laravel comes with an email sending library built in, so we just need to set it to use SendGrid over SMTP.

In `app/config/mail.php` you need to configure these settings:

[source, php]
----
<?php
return array(
  'driver' => 'smtp',
  'host' => getenv('SENDGRID_HOSTNAME'),
  'port' => 587,
  'from' => array('address' => 'from@example.com', 'name' => 'John Smith'),
  'encryption' => 'tls',
  'username' => getenv('SENDGRID_USERNAME'),
  'password' => getenv('SENDGRID_PASSWORD')
);

?>
----

You can use Laravel's Mail class just like you normally would, but all email will be sent through SendGrid!

[source, php]
----
Mail::send('emails.demo', $data, function($message)
{
    $message->to('jane@example.com', 'Jane Doe')->subject('This is a demo!');
});
----

Check out the docs for link:http://laravel.com/docs/mail[Laravel's mailer] for details.

[[php-wordpress]]
=== PHP: WordPress
Download the link:https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/sendgrid-email-delivery-simplified.zip[Official SendGrid WordPress Plugin].

Extract the zip archive file and move the Plugin folder to the `.openshift/plugins` directory of your repository (or to your `wp-content/plugins` folder if you're not using the default OpenShift WordPress installation).

Add the following code to `.openshift/config/wp-config.php` in your local repo:

[source, php]
----
// set credentials
define('SENDGRID_USERNAME', getenv('SENDGRID_USERNAME');
define('SENDGRID_PASSWORD', getenv('SENDGRID_PASSWORD');

// set email related settings
define('SENDGRID_SEND_METHOD', 'api');
----

Next, add and commit your changes link:managing-modifying-applications.html[using git]:

[source]
----
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adds fully configured SendGrid WordPress Plugin"
----

Deploy your changes to your live WordPress application with git:

[source]
----
$ git push
----

Next, you'll need to *activate the plugin* from the "Plugins" menu in the WordPress admin panel.

Finally, on the SendGrid plugin settings page you can set default values for the "Name", "Sending Address" and the "Reply Address", so that you don't need to set these headers every time you want to send an email from your application.

image::marketplace/sendgrid_dashboard.png[configure the SendGrid WordPress plugin settings]

That's it! WordPress emails will now be sent through SendGrid. For more information check out the link:https://wordpress.org/plugins/sendgrid-email-delivery-simplified/[official plugin page].

[[python]]
=== Python
Add the following to your link:http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#requirements-files[pip] `requirements.txt` file located at the root of your repository:

----
sendgrid>=1.2
----

Now you're ready to use SendGrid within your application:

[source, python]
----
import sendgrid, os

sg = sendgrid.SendGridClient(os.getenv('SENDGRID_USERNAME'), os.getenv('SENDGRID_PASSWORD'))

message = sendgrid.Mail()
message.add_to('John Doe ')
message.set_subject('Example')
message.set_text('Body')
message.set_from('Doe John ')
status, msg = sg.send(message)
----

For more information see the link:https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python[SendGrid Python] client library on GitHub.

[[python-django]]
=== Python: Django
Start by adding the following to `settings.py`:

[source, python]
----
import os

EMAIL_HOST = os.getenv('SENDGRID_HOSTNAME')
EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.getenv('SENDGRID_USERNAME')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.getenv('SENDGRID_PASSWORD')
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
----

Then to send email you can do the following:

[source, python]
----
from django.core.mail import send_mail
send_mail('Subject here', 'Here is the message.', 'from@example.com', ['to@example.com'], fail_silently=False)
----

There is more detailed information about sending email over SMTP with Django on the link:https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/email/[Django project website].

TIP: You may also send emails with Django by using the link:https://github.com/elbuo8/sendgrid-django[sendgrid-django] library, which utilizes the link:https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/index.html[Web API] instead of SMTP as the transport mechanism. 

[[ruby]]
=== Ruby
Add a link:http://bundler.io/gemfile.html[Gemfile] file named `Gemfile` to the root of your repository:

[source]
----
source 'http://mirror.ops.rhcloud.com/mirror/ruby/'
gem 'sendgrid-ruby'
----

TIP: Use link:https://developers.openshift.com/en/ruby-getting-started.html#_ruby_mirror[OpenShift's mirror of rubygems.org] as shown above to speed up your deployments.

Next, run `bundle install` (using link:http://bundler.io/[Bundler]) to create a Gemfile.lock file:

[source]
----
$ bundle install
----

Now you're ready to use SendGrid within your application:

[source, ruby]
----
require 'sendgrid-ruby'

client = SendGrid::Client.new(api_user: ENV['SENDGRID_USERNAME'], api_key: ENV['SENDGRID_PASSWORD'])

email = SendGrid::Mail.new do |m|
  m.to      = 'test@sendgrid.com'
  m.from    = 'you@youremail.com'
  m.subject = 'Sending with SendGrid is Fun'
  m.html    = 'and easy to do anywhere, even with Ruby'
end

client.send(email)
----
