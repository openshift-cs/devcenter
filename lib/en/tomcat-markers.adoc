[float]
= Tomcat Markers
Adding marker files to `.openshift/markers` will have the following effects:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Marker |Effect

|`enable_jpda`
|Will enable the JPDA socket based transport on the java virtual machine running the Tomcat server. This enables you to remotely debug code running inside Tomcat.

|`skip_maven_build`
|Maven build step will be skipped

|`force_clean_build`
|Will start the build process by removing all non-essential Maven dependencies.  Any current dependencies specified in your pom.xml file will then be re-downloaded.

|`hot_deploy`
|Will prevent a JBoss container restart during build/deployment. Newly build archives will be re-deployed automatically by the JBoss HDScanner component.

|`java7`
|Will run Tomcat with Java7 if present. If no marker is present then the baseline Java version will be used (currently Java6)
