The process of deploying Zend Server on OpenShift is very simple

[source]
--
$ rhc app create MyApp zend-6.1
$ rhc cartridge add mysql-5.5 -a MyApp
--

These two commands create your "server" and install and configure PHP, MySQL, and a git repository on the server. You can now visit your application on the web at:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/
--

Or in the Zend Server Console here:

[source]
--
http://MyApp-MyDomain.rhcloud.com/ZendServer
--

As MySQL was deployed for you by the platform, you can connect to it by using connection parameters exposed in the environment variables.
