To make your applications more portable, OpenShift shields it from the need to hard-code configuration into the source code. 

IMPORTANT: OpenShift provides environment variables that the application is supposed to consume as a way to configure itself -> link:overview-environment-variables.html[Environment variables]

As mentioned, in the previous example MySQL was deployed for the application. OpenShift publicizes the environment variables as part of the (in this case MySQL) service deployment.
