This cartridge adds periodic job execution functionality to your OpenShift application.

== Installation
To add this cartridge to your application, you can either add it when you create your application:

[source]
--
$ rhc app create <APP> ruby-1.9 cron
--

Or add it to your existing application:

[source]
--
$ rhc cartridge add cron -a <APP>
--

=== Creating a job
The jobs are organized in `.openshift/cron` directory of your application's source. Depending on how often you would like to execute the job, you place them in `minutely`, `hourly`, `daily`, `monthly`, `monthly`.

The jobs are executed directly. If it is a script, use the "shebang" line to specify the interpreter to execute it.

[source]
--
#! /bin/bash
date > $OPENSHIFT_RUBY_LOG_DIR/last_date_cron_ran
--

[NOTE]
====
The jobs need to be executable:

[source]
--
chmod +x .openshift/cron/minutely/awesome_job
--
====

=== Installing the job
Once you have created the job, add it to your application repository, commit and push.

[source]
--
git add .openshift/cron/minutely/awesome_job
git commit -m 'Execute bit set for cron job'
git push
--

=== Execution timing
The jobs are run by the node's `cron` at a specified frequency, however the exact timing is not guaranteed.
If this unpredictability is not desirable, you can instrument your job to inspect the date and/or time when your job runs.

For example, the following `minutely` job would do anything useful only at 12 minutes after the hour.

[source]
--
#!/bin/bash
minute=$(date '+%M')
if [ $minute != 12 ]; then
    exit
fi
# rest of the script
--
