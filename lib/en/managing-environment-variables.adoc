= Using Environment Variables
[.lead]
OpenShift has several environment variables to make it easy for your to configure your application to run properly.

The following tables show the variables, some examples of what the value would be, and what you might use them for. Depending on what extra cartridges you have enabled in your application, you may have more or less available variables. Also, values
may be slightly different for similar types of cartridges (for instance,
if you have a PostgreSQL database as opposed to MySQL).

If you'd like to see the exact values for your application, there are
two ways you can see your available variables.

1. Add `export` to your +.openshift/action_hooks/build+ file and push a new commit. You will beable to see the variables in your git output (they will all start with"remote: declare -x").

2. SSH into your application and run `env`

== Informational
These variables provide some information about your
application.

|===
|Variable Name|Example|Purpose

|OPENSHIFT_APP_DNS|appname-namespace.rhcloud.com|The fully-qualified domain name for your application
|OPENSHIFT_APP_NAME|appname|Your application's name
|OPENSHIFT_APP_UUID|0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef|The UUID your application runs as (32 hex characters)
|OPENSHIFT__IP|127.0.250.1|The IP address your application will listen on
|OPENSHIFT__PORT|8080|The port your application will receive requests from

|===

== Directories
These directories are where your application lives on
OpenShift. Please remember that the only directory that is guaranteed to
never be deleted is your `OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR`.

|===
|Variable Name|Example|Purpose

|OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR|$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/app-root/data/|A persistent directory for your data
|OPENSHIFT__LOG_DIR|$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR//logs/|Where your cartridge-specific logs are stored.
|OPENSHIFT__DB_LOG_DIR|$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR//log/|Where your database-specific logs are stored.
|OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR|$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/app-root/runtime/repo/|Repository containing the currently deployed version (of the application)
|OPENSHIFT_TMP_DIR|/tmp/|A temporary directory you can use.  Even though the path is just `/tmp`, the magic of SELinux protects your data from other users

|===

== Database
These variables pertain to your database (if you have one) and are used to connect your application to your database. The exact variable names depend upon the database type; the value of +<database>+ will be +MONGODB+, +MYSQL+, or +POSTGRESQL+ as appropriate.

|===
|Variable Name|Example|Purpose

|OPENSHIFT_<database>_DB_HOST|127.0.250.1|The hostname or IP address to use to connect to your database
|OPENSHIFT_<database>_DB_PORT|3306|The port your database server is listening on
|OPENSHIFT_<database>_DB_USERNAME|admin|Your database administrative username
|OPENSHIFT_<database>_DB_PASSWORD|8ddTnst22X3Y|Your database administrative user's password
|OPENSHIFT_<database>_DB_SOCKET|$OPENSHIFT_HOMEDIR/mysql-5.1/socket/mysql.sock|A AF socket you can use to connect to your database
|OPENSHIFT_<database>_DB_URL|mysql://admin:8ddTnst22X3Y@127.0.250.1:3306/|Database connection URL you can use to connect to your database
|===

== Jenkins
If your application includes Jenkins, you will have access to these variables as well.

|===
|Variable Name|Example|Purpose

|JENKINS_USERNAME|system_builder|System builder account on the jenkins server
|JENKINS_PASSWORD|RnmXQlavsb4f|Password for the system builder account on the jenkins server
|JENKINS_URL|https://jenkins-namespace.rhcloud.com/|DNS name for the associated
jenkins server (where builds get done)
|===

== Gear Information
These variables will be used if you have a scaling application.

|===
|Variable Name|Example|Purpose

|OPENSHIFT_GEAR_DNS|gearname-namespace.rhcloud.com|The fully-qualified domain name for this gear
|OPENSHIFT_GEAR_NAME|gearname|This gear's name
|OPENSHIFT_GEAR_UUID|0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef|The UUID for this gear
|===
