= OpenShift Online for Debian/Ubuntu
[.lead]
This tutorial is designed to help you get the most out of OpenShift Online on a Debian or Ubuntu machine. In addition to the link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console[web interface], OpenShift provides client tools (rhc) to help you create and manage your applications.

OpenShift allows a choice of environments (UI, command line, IDE), but in order to get the most out of your applications, you'll want to at least use the OpenShift client tools (*rhc*).

If you just want to log in and create your first application, you can simply log into the link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/login?then=%2Fapp%2Fconsole[web console (requires login)]. However, you won't be able to make changes to your application until you've followed the instructions below.

== Installing the Client Tools via Ruby gem
Installing the client tools this way on Ubuntu or Debian requires sudoer or root access and comprises three steps:

*Step 1*: Install *_Ruby_* with *_RubyGems_*

*Step 2*: Install *_Git_*

*Step 3*: Install the client tools

=== Step 1: Install Ruby with RubyGems

From terminal, run the following command to install Ruby:
[source]
----
$ sudo apt-get install ruby-full
----

Run the following command to verify that Ruby has installed correctly:
[source]
----
$ ruby -e 'puts "Welcome to Ruby"'
Welcome to Ruby
----

Rubygems are now part of the ruby package. However, with older Ubuntu repositories, you may need to run the following command to explicitly install RubyGems:
[source]
----
$ sudo apt-get install rubygems
----

=== Step 2: Install Git

Run the following command to install Git version control:
[source]
----
$ sudo apt-get install git-core
----

After installation completes, run the following command to verify that Git has installed correctly:
[source]
----
$ git --version
----

This command returns the Git version number that was installed.

=== Step 3: Install Client Tools

When the required software has been successfully installed, run the following command to install the client tools:
[source]
----
$ sudo gem install rhc
----
